Here is a roadmap / guide to AWS Sysops

First of all you will need about 6 months hands-on experience in AWS to get an idea on its services. Next take a look at the AWS whitepapers to see what is covered in the exams. To start with your learning you have lots of courses available in udemy. The course that I found helpful was the one from Stephane Maarek. Here are the links to the resources that I used :
