      <title>MCP Explained: How AI Tools and Agents Work Together</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-mcp&#34;&gt;What is MCP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCP stands for Model Context Protocol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a new open standard that enables AI agents to talk to tools and APIs and share information securely, in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLM + Tools = Agent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
MCP is what makes that ‚Äú+ Tools‚Äù part easier, flexible, and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;think-of-mcp-like-a-usb-c-cable&#34;&gt;Think of MCP Like a USB-C Cable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs break it down with a simple analogy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a &lt;strong&gt;laptop (Agent)&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;smartphone (Data Source)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to transfer photos from your phone to your laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, you use a &lt;strong&gt;USB-C cable (MCP)&lt;/strong&gt; to connect them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cable doesn‚Äôt care what brand your devices are as long as they speak the same protocol, they can share data seamlessly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine the same idea, but with AI tools:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-mcp">What is MCP?</h2>
<p><strong>MCP stands for Model Context Protocol.</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s a new open standard that enables AI agents to talk to tools and APIs and share information securely, in real time.</p>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p><strong>LLM + Tools = Agent.</strong><br>
MCP is what makes that ‚Äú+ Tools‚Äù part easier, flexible, and secure.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="think-of-mcp-like-a-usb-c-cable">Think of MCP Like a USB-C Cable</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs break it down with a simple analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a <strong>laptop (Agent)</strong> and a <strong>smartphone (Data Source)</strong>.</li>
<li>You want to transfer photos from your phone to your laptop.</li>
<li>So, you use a <strong>USB-C cable (MCP)</strong> to connect them.</li>
<li>The cable doesn‚Äôt care what brand your devices are as long as they speak the same protocol, they can share data seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now imagine the same idea, but with AI tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>laptop is an AI agent</strong> like Amazon Q or Claude.</li>
<li>The <strong>phone is a data source</strong> like a database, API, or local file.</li>
<li>The <strong>USB-C cable is MCP</strong> the protocol that lets these tools talk to each other and get things done.</li>
</ul>
<p>MCP acts like the connector between agents and the tools they need to be useful in real-world workflows.</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-use-case">A Real-World Use Case</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs say your company has important business data in a <strong>PostgreSQL database</strong>. You‚Äôd like a GenAI assistant to read from that data and generate reports or automate tasks.</p>
<p>With MCP, this becomes very doable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a <strong>PostgreSQL MCP server</strong> to expose that data.</li>
<li>Connect an <strong>agent (like Amazon Q)</strong> to it using MCP.</li>
<li>The agent can now securely query the database, generate insights, or automate reporting all while respecting any permissions you configure on the MCP server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, <strong>MCP works like an API layer between your tools and the agent</strong>, but with more flexibility and control.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="components-of-mcp">Components of MCP</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/what-is-mcp/assets/mcp-components.png" type="" alt="MCP Components"  /></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at the core pieces that make MCP work:</p>
<h4 id="mcp-server">MCP Server:</h4>
<p>A service that exposes a data source or tool like a database, CLI, or document for an agent to use.</p>
<h4 id="mcp-client">MCP Client:</h4>
<p>Usually the AI agent or model (like Claude or Amazon Q) that initiates the interaction by sending requests.</p>
<h4 id="mcp-protocol">MCP Protocol:</h4>
<p>The communication standard that defines how the client and server talk. Think of it like the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù they both understand.</p>
<h4 id="mcp-host">MCP Host:</h4>
<p>Where the MCP client or server runs. This might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>local machine</strong> (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE)</li>
<li>An <strong>app or agent</strong> hosted in the cloud using frameworks like LangChain or Strands</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="wrapping-it-all-up">Wrapping It All Up</h3>
<p>As you can see, <strong>MCP acts like the API/backend for agents</strong>, making them capable of interacting with the real world. Plugging in or removing tools could become as easy as installing a plugin or extension (like in Cursor IDE).</p>
<p>It‚Äôs early days, but the potential is huge and growing fast.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-want-to-try-it-yourself">üöÄ Want to Try It Yourself?</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôre curious to explore MCP, here are some next steps you can try out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up your own MCP server using the open-source <code>fastmcp</code> template: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fastmcp/1.0/">fastmcp on PyPI</a></li>
<li>Connect it to a database, folder, or API</li>
<li>Then test how an agent like Claude Desktop or Amazon Q can interact with it</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Thanks for reading! üéâ</p>
<p>If this post helped clarify what MCP is all about, feel free to share it, or let me know what you‚Äôre building with it. Excited to see where this goes!</p>

      <title>Multitenancy in AWS with account per tenant model</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/mlt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Multi-tenancy in the cloud is akin to running multiple, separate offices within a shared workspace. In technical terms, it means deploying a single software application or service that serves numerous users or clients, all isolated from one another. This approach maximises resource utilisation and cost-efficiency by sharing infrastructure and codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mlt-architectures&#34;&gt;MLT Architectures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Database, Separate Schemas&lt;/strong&gt;: In this approach, a single database is used to store data for all tenants, but each tenant has its own schema within the database. This architecture provides strong isolation between tenants while allowing efficient data management. It&amp;rsquo;s suitable for scenarios where tenants have similar data structures but need data separation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h2 id="mlt-architectures">MLT Architectures</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Single Database, Separate Schemas</strong>: In this approach, a single database is used to store data for all tenants, but each tenant has its own schema within the database. This architecture provides strong isolation between tenants while allowing efficient data management. It&rsquo;s suitable for scenarios where tenants have similar data structures but need data separation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/mlt/assets/schema_MLT.png" type="" alt="Schema seperated tenants"  /></p>
<p><strong>Database-per-Tenant</strong>: Each tenant has its own dedicated database instance. This approach offers the highest level of data isolation but can be resource-intensive and costly. It&rsquo;s suitable for scenarios where strict data separation is required.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/mlt/assets/db_MLT.png" type="" alt="Schema seperated tenants"  /></p>
<p><strong>Micro-services with API Gateway</strong>: Tenants are served by separate microservices, each with its own database. An API gateway manages tenant-specific routing and authentication. This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and strong isolation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/mlt/assets/routing_MLT.png" type="" alt="Schema seperated tenants"  /></p>
<p><strong>Account level isolation</strong>: A multi-tenancy architecture with separate AWS accounts involves assigning each tenant or customer their own dedicated AWS account. This architecture ensures robust isolation, security, and scalability between tenants. Each tenant manages their AWS resources independently, with IAM policies enforcing access control. Network isolation is achieved using separate VPCs. Monitoring, billing, and disaster recovery are handled individually for each tenant, allowing for customised solutions. This approach is ideal for scenarios where data separation and security are paramount, such as SaaS applications or managed service providers.</p>
<p>The Approach we will be looking today is <strong>Account Level Isolation.</strong></p>
